  <center>
  <p>
1. “If you double the number of experiments you do per year
<br> you’re going to double your inventiveness.”
<br>
<br>2. “What we need to do is always lean into the future;
<br> when the world changes around you and when it changes against you –
<br> what used to be a tail wind is now a head wind – 
<br> you have to lean into that and figure out what to do because complaining isn’t a strategy.”
<br>
<br>3. “One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.”
